// Code Snippet 1
function hello displays "hello" in the console
console log displays "Dojo"
Console log:
hello
Dojo

// Code Snippet 2
function hello displays "hello" in console and returns the value of 15.
variable result runs function hello
Console log:
result is 15

// Code Snippet 3
function numPlus takes the value num as its parameter
string and value is displayed in console.
function returns value of num + 15
variable "result" runs function numPlus with varaible 3, function returns 3 + 15 = 18.
console log:
num is 3
result is 18

// Code Snippet 4
variable num is declared to be 15
console log of num 15
function logAndReturn and return displays num in console and returns num
variable result runs function logAndReturn with value 10
console will log num 10 and return value 10 to variable result
console log:
15
10
10
15

The twist: While the function uses an established variable of "num" in the function, it does not give it a new value in the function. So when the function is run with a different value, it uses that value in the function.

// Code Snippet 5
variable num is declared to be 15 : num = 15
console displays num (15)
result runs function timesTwo with the value of 10
function logs value 10, returns 10*2 = 20 -> result = 20
console log:
15
10
20
15

// Code Snippet 6
function timesTwoAgain uses variable num in its function
console will log num initial value
num is doubled and returned as a result
variable result calls function twice, once for value 3 and 5
first function will log 'num is 3', double the value, and return 3*2 = 6
second function will log 'num is 5', double the value, and return 5*2 = 10
result is the sum of 6 + 10 = 16
console log:
num is 3
num is 5
result is 16

// Code Snippet 7
function sumNums will return the sum of the two numbers given to the function
first function call of (2,3) will return value of 5 and posted to console
second function call of (3,5) will return the value of 8 and posted to console
console log:
5
8

// Code Snippet 8
function printSumNums will print the first number in the console and return the sum of the two numbers given to the function
first function call of (2,3) will print the first number 2 to console and return the value of 5, which is also printed to console
second function call of (3,5) will pring the first number 3 to console and return the value of 8, which is also printed to console
console log:
2
5
3
8

// Code Snippet 9
function sumNums takes two numbers
function variable sum adds the two numbers, which is then printed to console, and the sum is returned as the result
variable result runs sumNums twice and adds the two results
first function call of (2,3), sum = 2 + 3 = 5, console prints string and sum, and function returns value 5
second function call of (3,5), sume = 3 + 5 = 8, console prints string and sum, and function returns value 8
result adds two values together = 5 + 8 = 13
console log:
sum is 5
sum is 8
result is 13

// Code Snippet 10
function sumNums takes two numbers, add them together for variable sum, displays a string in console, and returns value of sum
variable result uses function multiple times
first value sumNums(2,3) -> adds numbers 2 + 3 = 5 -> console: 'sum is 5' -> returns value 5
inner value of sumNums(2,1) calulated first -> 2 + 1 = 3 -> console: 'sum is 3' -> returns value 3
second value sumNums(3, previous function result of 3) -> 3 + 3 = 6, console: 'sum is 6' -> returns value 6
inner value of sumNums(2,1) -> 2 + 1 = 3 -> console: 'sum is 3' -> returns value 3
second inner value of sumNums(2,3) -> 2 + 3 = 5 -> console: 'sum is 5' -> returns value 5
third value sumNums(previous function result of 3, previous function result of 5) -> 3 + 5 = 8 -> console: 'sum is 8' -> returns value of 8
result = 5 + 6 + 8 = 19
console log:
sum is 5
sum is 3
sum is 6
sum is 3
sum is 5
sum is 8
result is 19
